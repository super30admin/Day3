// ## Problem3
// Search in Infinite sorted array: 

// https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-sorted-array-of-unknown-size/

// Given a sorted array of unknown length and a number to search for, return the index of the number in the array. 
// Accessing an element out of bounds throws exception. If the number occurs multiple times, return the index of any occurrence. 
// If it isnâ€™t present, return -1.

// It is a leetcode premium question

// Solution:
// Description: 
// In this we will first find the index as we dont know the size of an array. Also, 
// The approach we will follow is: At the start we will keep low at 0 and high at 1 and check if the arr[high] > target. 
// we will keep increasing low to high and high by 2 in each step till we meet a condition that the target may low between low and high 
// Now here why are we multiplying by 2 and not by 3, 4 or taking a square etc. Because, in binary search we divide the space in 2 and also 
// we dont want to increase the search space as once we get the indexes we will then have to apply Binary Search
// Time Complexity :O (log n)
// Space Complexity :O(1)
