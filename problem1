// Time Complexity : O(n*m) where n is the number of rows and m is number of columns
// Space Complexity : O(1)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : Yes, I initially solved it in O(n+m) by checking whether the target lies between the first and last element of each row.
//Then I tried performing Binary search on rows after checking whether the target lies in between the first and last element of each row. This took me O(n*log m).
//I did not receive the idea of flattening the 2D to 1D array
