Your code here along with comments explaining your approach in three sentences only
This question contains 2 parts:
(i)Finding the smallest number in the form of pow(2,k) which is greater than or equal to the size of the array and the probable index
ranges for these 2 numbers.
(ii) Performing binary search on the range of indices found above.
 I did the first part by constantly doubling the estimated size of array, until the element found is greater than target
 Then applied BS on the range of half of the above index to the above index.
