Your code here along with comments explaining your approach in three sentences only
I first checked if the array is rotated. If it is rotated, then I used binary search to find the length by which the array is rotated.
Binary search can be used to find the point of rotation and then I chop the array into 2 sorted ascending ordered lists and perform
binary search on these 2 lists.
